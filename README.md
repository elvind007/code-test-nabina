Project Overview
The RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Employee Management System is a web application designed to manage employee information and access levels within an organization. The system implements role-based access control, where users are assigned roles (Admin, HR, Employee) that determine their access rights within the system.


Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js with Vite as the build tool. React Router is used for routing within the application.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js for creating RESTful APIs. MySQL is used as the database management system to store employee and category information.
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for authentication. Bcrypt is used for password hashing.
File Upload: Multer is used for handling file uploads, allowing users to upload employee photos.

Deployment
Backend: The backend is hosted on Railway.
Frontend: The frontend is hosted on Vercel.
Database: The MySQL database is hosted on a cloud platform.
